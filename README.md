<h3>Workforce App Provider</h3>

Workforce App Provider is a mobile application designed to empower young people in Ghana with TVET (Technical and Vocational Education and Training) skills. The app provides a digital marketplace where artisans (plumbers, electricians, carpenters, masons, painters, and other skilled professionals) can connect with clients in need of reliable handyman services.

This is the Provider App, built specifically for artisans and service providers to:
<ul>
<li>Create professional profiles.</li>
<li>Showcase their skills and availability.</li>
<li>Accept and manage job requests.</li>
<li>Track job history and earnings.</li>
  
</ul>


The platform works like an Uber-style service for artisans, bridging the gap between skilled youth and clients who need trustworthy, on-demand services.

<h3>Features</h3>
For Artisans (Providers):

<ol>

<li>Profile Creation & Verification – Build a professional profile with your skills, certifications, and experience.</li>

<li>Service Categories – Register under multiple handyman categories (plumbing, carpentry, electricals, etc.).</li>

<li>Real-time Job Requests – Receive service requests from nearby clients.</li>

<li>Job Management – Accept, decline, and track ongoing jobs.</li>

<li>Earnings Dashboard – Monitor completed jobs and income history.</li>

<li>GPS Integration – Locate clients easily and update your service radius.</li>

</ol>

The Workforce platform has two apps:
<ul>
<li>Workforce App Provider (this repo) – for artisans and service providers.</li>
